A sketch of (one) possible way of designing the evolutionary algorithm  

1. Breed n networks
2. For each network
		for m rounds:
			apply pressure
			reduce
			solve
			dump instances + solution + difficult score 
			
3. Select the top k networks, k << n, and breed n networks out of them 
4. Go to 1


-----------------------------
How to score an instance: 
you could judge an instance difficulty by looking into red/green/grey genes, but looking into disparity of benefits/damage values, 
by looking into a "normalized" knapsack value, i.e. :
			say there are 10 objects that each contribute a value of 2
			the effective contribution of those is: 2*10/10 = 2
